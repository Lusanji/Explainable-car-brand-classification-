#  Explainable car brand classification using machine learning 

The main objectives of this project include:
1). Classifying car based on three classes of brands by applying transfer learning techniques such as ResNet-50, VGG-16 and VGG-19 classifiers on image dataset collected from Google and comparing the performance of these classifiera.
2). Applying various explainable techniques such as LIME and GRAD-CAM to explian the black-box deep learning transfer techniques used.
